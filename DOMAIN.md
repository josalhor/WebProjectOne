# Domain specific knowledge

We've made a few changes to the models of our application since we submitted the pre-assignment:

- We've included the Category of books for best sellers: BestSellersListName (resembling the name of the NYT API)
- We've included a Best Sellers model that represents the relationship (day, list_best_sellers) -> [books]
